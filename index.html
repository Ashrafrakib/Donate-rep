            <h2>Qurbani (Sacrificing animals) for all</h2>
            <p>Qurbani for all is part of the regular humanitarian activities of the As-Sunnah Foundation. Since its
                inception, the Foundation has been conducting sacrificial activities on behalf of pious rich people
                among the poor.</p>

            <h2>Distribution of relief to flood victims</h2>
            <p>During the monsoon season, about 26,000 sq km of Bangladesh is flooded every year. At this time,
                especially in the northern part of the country, in particular the Banavasi people are often the victims
                of extreme misery. The As Sunnah Foundation conducts relief activities every year in the flood-hit
                districts of the country and takes the initiative to stand by the needy and helpless people.</p>

        <div class="plan3">
            <h2>Sadaqah (Charity) Jariyah</h2>
            <p>Sadqah Jariyah means: that the benefits of charity are not just one-time; Rather it continues for a long
                time. The benefits of a charity that is earned only once are rewarded only once. On the other hand,
                Allah, the Almighty, continues to reward for the benefits of the charity which last for a long time.</p>
